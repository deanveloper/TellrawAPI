# TellrawAPI
==========

Chances are, if you are a server owner, you are simply here because one of your plugins rely on this plugin in order to function correctly. If you are a server owner, just put this in your plugins.
If you are a developer, keep on reading to learn how to use this properly!

## Usage

Create multiple objects that each contain StringBuilders. After you create all of them, you must finalize it (You can finalize multiple of them together). Then a method that lets you send the StringBuilder (or a string if that's your style) can let you either send it to either one, multiple, or all players!
